          <p>Welcome to my blog main page. Don't know what I'll write here. Most of the blogs I've read
            and appreciated contain important or useful technical information, which I don't know 
            any of to share. <br><br>
            I could also use it to share my opinions and participate in the broader 
            social discourse using the inspiring and powerful technology that is the internet,
            I think I'm 15-20 years too late for that. I think the forum for that nowadays is 
            probably Twitter, but I find that rather vapid and certainly not inspiring. Besides,
            this venture could be rather dangerous, as I've been treating this as more of a professional site.
            Well, at any rate, this discussion is rather moot until I at least get to the point of 
            getting this up on the main branch. <br>><br>
            I may also use it to sandbox different designs and subdomain-stuff.
